            LANGLEY, VAâ€”A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical
             intelligence information with black highlighters.
             <br>
             <br>
             According to the report, sections of the documentsâ€” "almost invariably the most crucial passages"â€”are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read,
              due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
              <br>
              <br>
              CIA Director Porter <b>Goss lamented</b>  the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li> the Cold War </li>
                <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
                <li> the growth of the international drug trade</li>
              </ul>
